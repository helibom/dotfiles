# dotfiles

dotfiles shared between home and work machines

## ZSH

- If stow does not symlink `./zsh/.zplug` properly, you might have to symlink it manually for some reason

## Neovim

The stow package `nvchad` is my older neovim template config from the NvChad project.

The stow package `neovim` is my newer, custom Neovim configuration.
